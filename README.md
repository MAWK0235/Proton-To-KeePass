# Proton-To-KeePass (Enhanced Fork)

Convert your **Proton Pass** vault into a secure, offline **KeePass KDBX** file â€“ with full field support, TOTP handling, and intelligent mapping.

> This is a heavily modified fork of the original project [cadomac/Proton-To-KeePass](https://github.com/cadomac/Proton-To-KeePass). It fixes major bugs, improves compatibility, and ensures **ALL data** from Proton Pass exports is safely migrated into KeePass.
